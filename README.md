This web application provides a platform where one can join their friends and talk about their favorite teams and players. An individual can create a profile page with their favorite teams and players. The application also supports multiple simultaneous chat rooms and individual chats.

In addition, the application stores the individualâ€™s credentials and preferences in a persistent data store, file or database. It also provides some authentication and authorization mechanism.

The application is in 3 parts, a web UI, a centralized process to manage the chat and chat rooms and persist the credentials and a persistent storage mechanism.
